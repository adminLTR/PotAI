# 🌱 PotAI – AI & IoT-based Water-Efficient Plant Care

Welcome to **PotAI**, an intelligent and sustainable plant watering system powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)**. This project is designed to minimize water usage by determining the exact amount of water a plant needs, based on real-time environmental data.

## 🚀 Project Overview

PotAI is a smart pot system that:

- **Analyzes multiple inputs** such as:
  - Plant type
  - Soil moisture
  - Air temperature and humidity
  - Light intensity
- **Calculates the optimal amount of water** (in milliliters) for the plant
- **Automatically waters** the plant using a water pump
- **Continuously monitors** plant conditions and only waters again when needed
- **Provides a user-friendly interface** to:
  - Visualize real-time data
  - Manage multiple plants or pots (multi-plant support)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Sensors gather environmental data.
2. **Intelligent Processing**: An AI model determines the plant’s water needs based on current conditions.
3. **Irrigation**: A water pump dispenses the exact amount of water required.
4. **Visualization**: A visual interface shows all relevant metrics to the user in real time.
5. **Multiple Plants**: The system supports managing several plants at once.
